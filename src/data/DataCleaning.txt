Locate all countries in the uniqueCountries Set. Find them on the map. If they
have 0, but are in uniqueCountries, there is a problem. Do find / replace in csv/json to correct this.

Examples: 

// Changed Czech Republic and Czechoslovakia to Czechia


*/ Need to handle "KOREA" entries
*/ Need to handle "SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO"
*/ Need to handle "STATELESS"
*/ Need to handle "UNKNOWN"
*/ Need to handle "YUGOSLAVIA"
